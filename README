Issues:

* Fullscreen mode code is iffy (shouldn't need to create a new JFrame everytime).
* Fullscreen mode always picks the primary monitor.
* Probably should be using Maven or Ant or something instead of make


Todo:

* Applet Version
* Animations
* More event based interaction with the model
* Split of a Controller (so we can be all MVC).
